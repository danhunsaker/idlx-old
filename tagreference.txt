IDLX Tag Reference:

<idlx:iface>						-	The root element.
<idlx:script lang="">				-	IDLX-S modules are triggered by these blocks.  The specific
										module to use is indicated, in full lowercase, in the lang
										attribute.  Keep in mind that any XML within these blocks 
										will only be processed after the script has run, so it must 
										survive script execution to be evaluated.  (This allows 
										script blocks to return full Interfaces, if needed, or even 
										other script blocks.)
<idlx:report>						-	Report modules are triggered by these blocks.
	<idlx:input>					-	Defines the report to process.
		<idlx:format>				-	Identifies which Reports Module to use.
		<idlx:description>			-	Identifies the report description file to use.
	<idlx:output>					-	Defines the way to present the report to the user.
		<idlx:format>				-	Identifies the desired output format (i.e., PDF).
		<idlx:return>				-	Identifies the desired method for presenting the finished
										report to the user.  Valid values:
											interface	::	Present the report within the UI.
											separate	::	Present the report as a download (or a 
															"save as" outside a web interface).
											link		::	Present the report as a hyperlink (or 
															something similar in non-web contexts).
											local		::	Store the report in the Project 
															directories for later use.  Like link, 
															but does not provide direct access in 
															the Interface itself.
											test		::	Don't actually present the report.
										Possible extended values, assuming module/Project support:
											email		::	Email the report to the user.
											print		::	Print the report.  Printer in name tag.
										Of course, any module can define its own values, though it 
										must register them with the core.
		<idlx:name>					-	Provides a filename hint for the final report, when valid.
<idlx:asis>							-	Identifies a block of text that should not be interpreted
										as IDLX code.  These blocks must always be CDATA to avoid 
										confusing the XML parser.  This allows passing raw XML and 
										text all the way through to the UI platform.  The asis tag 
										and CDATA delimiters will be stripped from the output.
<idlx:table>						-	Identifies a table to pull data from.  This table is used 
										until another table tag is encountered.
<idlx:record>						-	Identifies a record to pull data from.  This record is used 
										until the parser encounters either a table tag or another
										record tag.
<idlx:field alt="">					-	Identifies a field to pull data from.  The XUID engine is 
										responsible for determining whether the user has sufficient 
										access rights to allow the field to be used in the manner 
										which it was defined.  That is, if a field tag is used in a 
										XUID element which allows the user to modify the value, the 
										engine is responsible for disabling that element's editing 
										capability if the user doesn't have sufficient access to 
										permit modification.  The field tag's alt attribute allows 
										the Framework to provide a fallback value in case the user 
										does not have read rights.
